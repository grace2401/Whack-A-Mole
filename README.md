Whack-a-Mole Game

This is a simple browser-based Whack-a-Mole game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players have to "whack" moles that randomly pop up from holes while avoiding hitting piranha plants. 
The score increases when the player successfully whacks a mole but ends the game if they hit a plant.
